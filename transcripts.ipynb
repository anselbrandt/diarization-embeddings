Well, they're more than men. They're supposed to be more apologetic than men statistically. And that, for example, if you're walking through the office and you're looking down at your phone and a woman is walking the opposite way looking down at her phone and you bump into each other, the woman will be more inclined to say, oh, I'm sorry. Or if... If you're in line for coffee and it's unclear who's the next one in line, the woman is more likely to say, I'm sorry, you go ahead, or something like that, even though the man would want to be traditionally chivalrous or something. The women are more ready to apologize and take blame, and they did some study where they were actually like – checking how many times a woman says, I'm sorry in a given day.

I know how it is. So I can't blame you, my seatmate for this, for this problem. And in fact, as we know, you can blame no one except global capitalism. It's the only thing you can be mad at.

I'm constantly trying to move the furniture around in these big mirrored rooms to make them seem more livable. And so part of that is food.

So that awareness or that sort of daily consciousness, I guess in me it promotes an understanding that we're actually doing the best we can right now. The system that we have is a three-legged dog. It is a broken transmission. It is all these terrible things. It does have excesses and abuses threaded into it.

Obviously, they don't have your prescription in them, but they're just the dummy lenses. But you get to try them on and see how they look, and you get to keep them for – I think you keep them for either five or seven days. so you can try them on, see how they look. and decide which ones you'd like and which ones you want to order. And you know what? If like that first set of five, if, if you can't figure out which one you like and you want to try it, they let you do this multiple times and it doesn't cost anything until you figure out which one you want. You get the one you want. You're like, okay, this is the pair I want. Then you send them all back. They pay for all that. Then you put in your order. And you get to pair really, really great lenses. Now, I've got like. my vision isn't terrible, but it's weird because I've got an astigmatism and I'm nearsighted and it's different in each eye. And the lens has to be at like a certain rotation for the astigmatism to work. It's complicated. It's not good.\",\n",

The only way to get the kind of glasses that I prefer was to buy vintage glasses. And that required a lot of work sorting through bins and visiting strange people in weird parts of town. And sometimes you would find an old... optometrist where they still had a bunch of vintage frames in the basement but the old man that was running the place didn't really want to go down there. you could talk him into it go down and find a thing. and you know I bought so many pairs of vintage glasses and Where it still had the original price tag on it from the fifties and sixties. And, and, and then when you would get lenses put in them, you always were worried that the plastic was, had decayed and was going to crack.\",\n",
       " 'Speaker 1: Right.',\n",
       " \"Speaker 0: So when I was out in the world roaming around the streets of America and Europe, and I would see someone at a distance wearing a pair of glasses, which I, I instantly identified as vintage glasses. That person would also see me wearing, And I knew how much work they'd put into that and they knew how much work I'd put into it. So we would nod and sometimes even stop and talk. I remember one time in a cafe in Hamburg, the guy behind the counter was wearing a pair of glasses, which I... coveted and knew were very special. and I said those glasses and he said yeah well I found them in Berlin from a man with a special place and he had a dog and it was a red dog. and we had this long conversation about the great adventure he'd gone on to find this particular pair of frames and I'm always telling the story of the glasses I'm wearing and so forth. it was always a a real indicator of a certain kind of person. and warby parker's frames are all designed very much according to the principles of like vintage. yeah for sure they look very very classic. and so just a few years ago when warby parker came on the scene I was suddenly in this position where I would see somebody in an airport or in a grocery store and I would see their glasses and feel like, here is an entree to talk to this person. And I would walk up to them and say, your glasses, they're extraordinary. Tell me about that. And the person would look at me shocked and say, they're Warby Parker. And I would go, oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I interrupted your day. Like, you know, you're free to go. I just thought, because at any other time in my life, I would have... You know, marched up to this person and gone, your glasses, tell me about them. And they would have said in nineteen seventy nine. I was in, you know, I was in the deserts of Sumaria and so forth. So it has changed my social equation. now because I see people in the world wearing glasses that, you know, that I spent twenty five years. I spent thirty years wearing. training myself to see these see a certain kind of frame and know what it meant. yeah and now it means a different thing now. now regular people have access to these frames. regular people have access to these styles. people who do not want to be in the basement of a optometrist in chinatown and that is very complicated. so i have never had a pair of warby parker glasses. But I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready to go through the looking glass and try on and take the risk and have the adventure. Have the adventure of this new way into this look. So now I can walk up to somebody in an airport and say, are those Warby Parkers? And they're going to look at me and go...\",\n",

       " \"Speaker 1: Um, I had this idea for rituals and routines as an overarching topic. And this occurred to me because, and I've talked on the air about these neighbors that I have before across the street who had this red light on. But the other neighbors next to them across the street And for those who are fans of Back to Work, this is the same ones that had the kid who was chucking around the wooden rifle. They have a series of different lights on the front of their house. They have what I would call their garden lights, which are mixed through all the plants that they turn on the lights and it shines. This one shines on this tree. This one is behind the shrubs over here. This one illuminates the little path.\",\n",

       " \"Speaker 1: And then they also have sort of the, what I would just call the house, house lights, which are, you know, to the left and the right of the main entry of the door, you know, so that you turn those on and that's like how you would see if you were walking up to the door, you'd know where you're going. There's no prowlers or whatever. And then they have their motion sensor light, which is over by the garage so that if you maybe forgot to put the other lights on and you're driving up at night, the light, your car drives up, and the light automatically turns on, and then you can find your way into the garage. And I feel like I have, and it occurred to me over the last, because what I do is as I'm on my way up to bed, I will, you know, we have like a window in our door. Does that make sense?\",\n",
       " 'Speaker 0: Yes.',\n",
       " \"Speaker 1: And I will look, I will glance out the window on my way past the door going upstairs, and I just sort of notice, you know, I sort of take stock of what's going on before I go up. That makes sense. You know, why not? See what's going on. And there's no rhyme or reason to how they use these lights. My lights... When I put the kids to bed, I come downstairs and I turn on the main lights on the outside of the house. And then in the morning when I come down, if one of them hasn't already turned it off, I will turn it off.\",\n",
       " \"Speaker 0: You've got a rhyme and a reason.\",\n",
       " \"Speaker 1: I've got it. And I feel like – and yes, we have a motion sensor light also. But these people across the street – They use different combinations. Sometimes it's just the landscaping. Sometimes it's the landscaping and the lights around. Oh, and they also have a green light that they'll put on periodically. And it makes no sense how they do it. Different times, it doesn't matter. And it's driving me nuts. But that's a separate topic. It just occurred to me as I was thinking about that that I seem to have these routines. I seem to have these things that I do That I guess I draw some kind of comfort in doing them. And it's not like if it doesn't happen that I can't sleep or something like that or like I'll be tossing and turning in bed if I don't do whatever the thing is. But I definitely – and this leads to I guess back to my OCD stuff. Which I also noticed there is even – sometimes I'll have a similar thought pattern as I'm doing the certain thing that has become the kind of ritual. And I'm aware that I'm having that. even while I'm doing it, but it must be working for some reason to do that. And I realize going into the show today, you strike me as the kind of person that doesn't have a lot of that, where every day might be a bit different for you and maybe you like it that way. Am I off base with that?\",\n",
       " 'Speaker 0: No, I do not have... Very many routines.',\n",
       " 'Speaker 1: Like when you wake up, is there a thing that you do in the day? Like when you wake up in the morning, if it is the morning, is there a certain time of day when you would wake up? or is it entirely based on when you went to bed the night before? Do you drink coffee? Do you have like one cup of coffee and then you do this other thing? or is it just every day is different?',\n",
       " \"Speaker 0: I'm a person probably like a lot of our listeners, just a normal person who does not like to go to sleep and also does not like to wake up. So when it's time to go to sleep, I do everything I can to avoid going to sleep. I sit and read until I'm too exhausted to hold up my... book and then i go downstairs and get a drink of water and then maybe i'll take a little handful of popcorn and then i'll go back upstairs and lay down and maybe i'll play solitaire on my phone for a while. whatever it is i hate to finally succumb. turn off the light roll over go to sleep and i will stay up for hours and hours rather than um. rather than just make the decision, now it is time for sleep. And so I never go to sleep at a regular time because I'm always trying to push that boundary, just push it a little bit further. I can read two more pages of this book, just a little longer. I don't know why that is true. I just don't like to give up. And then once I... have turned off the light and am sleeping. I love being asleep. And in the morning when it's time to wake up, I do not want to wake up. I want to roll over and go back to sleep as long as I possibly can. So I will first become kind of awake and aware at seven or eight o'clock in the morning. And I will say, oh, that's terrible. Seven o'clock in the morning. Awful, awful times. And I'll roll over and go back to sleep. And then it'll be eight and then it'll be nine. And I will keep doing that. And at a certain point, the idea enters into my mind that now it's late. Now I have slept too long. And my reaction to that is generally to try and put that feeling out of my mind by rolling over and going back to sleep again. Okay. And depending on where I am in my bipolar cycle, I sometimes will sleep until one o'clock in the afternoon by that method. And other times, you know, at nine o'clock in the morning, I finally have enough to do, have enough scheduled that I have to get up. So for instance, this morning, I knew that I had a podcast with you at a certain point. But also, my daughter has to get up and go to school in the morning. So I wake up, I get her up and going to school. And that is a thing that, you know, is... I have help from my mom in doing. And there are times when the burden of getting my daughter up and off to school falls entirely to me. And other times I have, it is a cooperative effort. And other times other people in my daughter's life get her up and get her to school and allow me to kind of sleep in because everybody in my family knows about this problem. But then back to sleep, I went and And slept until I was absolutely up against the deadline of needing to get up and come to my office to podcast with you. And so one of the ways I try and live a normal life is I schedule things at a certain hour in the morning where it requires that I be up like a regular person. But then I resent those appointments because they are forcing me up. Anyway, so every single day is different because every day has a first appointment. And sometimes that first appointment is eight a.m. and sometimes it's ten a.m. But I will sleep right up until the last possible moment, no matter what the rule is. And then making coffee of my own in the morning is very... It requires that I be up early enough to make coffee. And I always... would rather sleep until the last possible moment rather than get up and make a pot of coffee, even though I want coffee. So I tried to buy one of those coffee makers that was on a timer that would make the coffee for me, but that required that I do the work at night. And I didn't really want to do that either. And so you're starting to get a picture, I hope, of how burdensome I find almost everything. And what that means is that I'm always just being prodded along with the cattle prod of responsibility. And it moves me from one thing to the next, but never according to an architecture of a ritual or a scheme or a plan. It's always just an alarm is going off. And I've pushed the snooze button. And this is true in the day too, right? It's right now, it's quarter till here. And I made some plan to meet somebody later. And I told them I would be there between a certain time and another time. And all of that is just an attempt to prod me on this sort of baton death March that is living a life.\",\n",

So I recommend that. But you just need a nonstick pan. That's step one. Okay, but like you can get these like green earth frying pans. Anyway, I'll put it in the show notes. You can do with any pan as long as it's nonstick. So you get your nonstick pan and you have a spatula. Spatula has to be plastic because you got to use plastic on the nonstick.\",\n",

If you do it on a high heat, there's something about the way high heat will affect the proteins of the egg, I'm told, that cause it to get sort of ropey. And so like. if you ever go to like one of those like greasy spoon diners and you get the eggs that are sort of like – chewier or tougher or something that's just because they're in a hurry. they want to cook these things fast so they got the heat cranked up.\",\n",

The first one is it's going to be a mess if you do it that way because as soon as you crack it that way, the egg is immediately going to start pouring out of there onto the side of the bowl, dripping down the side of the bowl. The drip goes down to the countertop more to clean. Don't do that.

I have all this money. I have this huge house. Now, what do I do? I've got this, I've got these euros in this Filson bag. I've got the best virtual reality headset that I could have. the tech guys at my company buy. build right but there's really not that much content for VR gaming yet and you know what do I do? what do I do and what? what we're offering them is the opportunity to take some of that money and invest it and get involved in the larger enterprise of of global capitalism by becoming investors owners And that's a great opportunity.
